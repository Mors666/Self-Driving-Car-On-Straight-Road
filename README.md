# 🏎️ Self-Driving Car Simulation (No Libraries)  

This is a **self-driving car simulation** built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript** (without any external libraries). The project demonstrates the concepts of **autonomous driving**, **collision detection**, **sensor simulation**, and **artificial neural networks** by implementing every component from scratch.  

The car learns to drive on a straight road and optimize its behavior using a neural network that simulates basic decision-making capabilities.

## 🚀 Features
- 🕹️ **Car Driving Mechanics**: Simulates acceleration, braking, and turning.
- 🌎 **Environment Setup**: Straight road and borders defined programmatically.
- 🔥 **Sensor Simulation**: Virtual sensors detect nearby obstacles and lane boundaries.
- 💥 **Collision Detection**: Prevents the car from leaving the road or hitting obstacles.
- 🧠 **Neural Network AI**: The car learns how to control itself using a custom-built neural network.
- 🖤 **No External Libraries**: Entirely written in plain JavaScript.
- 🖌️ **Neural Network Visualization**: Displays how the neural network makes decisions in real time.
