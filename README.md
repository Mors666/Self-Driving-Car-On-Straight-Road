## ðŸ§¾ About the Project

This is a **pure JavaScript** simulation of a self-driving car built entirely from scratch â€” no libraries, no frameworks, just raw code.

The project demonstrates how a car can learn to navigate a straight road using a **custom-built neural network** and **virtual sensors** (ray-casting). It provides an educational insight into how self-driving logic can be implemented manually â€” step by step.

Whether you're new to AI or curious about how autonomous driving logic works, this project serves as an excellent hands-on learning experience.
